## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI API / Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gongzhen/codewhisper.git](https://github.com/gongzhen/codewhisper.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd codewhisper
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## üí° Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application.

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  Interact with the AI assistant via the user interface.

### Example: Generating a Function

To generate a Python function that calculates a Fibonacci sequence, you could enter the following prompt in the UI:

> "Write a Python function that returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence."

CodeWhisper will then generate the corresponding code snippet for you to use or modify.
