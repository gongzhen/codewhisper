##  Overview

CodeWhisper is an AI-powered project designed to assist developers in generating, modifying, and understanding code. It leverages advanced language models to streamline software development tasks, reduce boilerplate, and improve overall productivity.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Code-Aware Chat**: Engage in a conversation with an AI that has context of your selected code files. Ask questions, get explanations, and request documentation for your codebase.
- **Context-Aware File Selection**: Use the built-in file explorer to browse your project and select specific files or directories to include in the conversation, giving the AI focused context for its answers.
- **Apply AI-Suggested Code Changes**: The application can generate `diff` patches, and you can apply these suggested changes directly to your code with the click of a button.
- **Rich Content and Data Visualization**: The AI can respond with more than just text. It can generate and display complex content, including Markdown, tables, and even D3.js and Graphviz diagrams for data visualization.
- **Multi-Language Syntax Highlighting**: View code in the chat with proper syntax highlighting for a wide variety of popular programming languages.
- **Persistent Chat History**: All your conversations are saved locally in your browser's IndexedDB, allowing you to resume them at any time. You can also import and export your chat history as a JSON file.
- **Real-Time Streaming Responses**: Get instant feedback as the AI generates its response in real-time, thanks to server-sent events (SSE).
